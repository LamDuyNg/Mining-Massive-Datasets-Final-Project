# Dimensionality Reduction on CIFAR-10 with SVD

This project is a part of the Mining Massive Datasets course at Tôn Đức Thắng University. I was responsible for **Task 2: Dimensionality Reduction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Description
- Performed dimensionality reduction on the CIFAR-10 image dataset, reducing each image from 1024 dimensions to 64 dimensions.
- The reduced dataset can be used for efficient data analysis and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- PySpark
- Python
- SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

## My Contribution
I implemented the dimensionality reduction process, using SVD to compress the CIFAR-10 dataset images. The reduced-dimensional data was saved for future processing and analysis.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries (add any specific commands here).
3. Run `task2_svd.py` to execute the SVD process on CIFAR-10 dataset.
